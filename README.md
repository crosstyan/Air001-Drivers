# Arduino-Air001-Drivers

Air001的Arduino驱动（包含HAL和LL库）

## CMake

See [air001-cmake-hal](https://github.com/crosstyan/air001-cmake-hal/blob/81c16517ab7fa3471b26f6c1416741c8f0bacd9c/lib/CMakeLists.txt#L1-L25)

## DSP

Upstream is [ARM-software/CMSIS-DSP](https://github.com/ARM-software/CMSIS-DSP).
Seems an old version of CMSIS-DSP is included,
but I can't really see if it's used anywhere in Arduino.
